Here are the things that you'll need for the python scripts:

1. Install serial drivers for your machine http://prolificusa.com/pl-2303hx-drivers/
2. Make sure you have pip installed https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/
3. `pip install pygame` - we use pygame for its midi library
4. Run `python roshanai_serial.py` for the usage.
